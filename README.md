# Cross-Site-Request-Forgery

Cross site request forgery (CSRF), also known as XSRF, is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action in an application to which a user is logged in. 

Synchronizer Tokens :  The synchronizer token pattern requires the generating of random "challenge" tokens that are associated with the user's current session.

Double Submit Cookie : A double submit cookie is defined as sending a random value in both a cookie and as a request parameter, with the server verifying if the cookie value and request value match.
